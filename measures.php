                <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others to reduce your risk of infection when they cough, sneeze or speak. Maintain an even greater distance between yourself and others when indoors. The further away, the better.</li>
                    <li>Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal are essential to make masks as effective as possible.</li>
                    <li>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.</li>
                    <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
                    <li>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</li>
                    <li>Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
                    <li>Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.</li>
                    <li>Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</li>
                    <li>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Here are the basics of how to wear a mask:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.</li>
                    <li>Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin.</li>
                    <li>When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.
                    </li>
                    <li>Don’t use masks with valves.</li>
                </ul>
